The "Probability and Probability Distributions" course typically provides an in-depth understanding of probability theory and its applications, focusing on the study of various probability distributions, their properties, and how they are used to model real-world phenomena.

R is often chosen over Python Language for this course due to its strong statistical capabilities, extensive collection of packages for specialized statistical techniques, and its built-in functions for handling various probability distributions. R's syntax and data visualization tools are also well-suited for statistical analysis and interpretation, making it a preferred choice for courses that emphasize statistical theory and data analysis.
